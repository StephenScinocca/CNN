All of the code was done using google collab and cuda

## Linear_Model

This is the python notebook for my linear model

## CNN

This is the python notebook that contains my code for its convolutional neural network and the data visualization that can generate new images based on the classes of the CNN

## Resnet

This is the python notebook that uses resnet with untrained parameters and trains them
